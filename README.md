# Movie-Recommendation-System: Project Overview
- This project has two main objectives.
- One of the main objective is to create a recommendation system to give users the opportunity to watch movies similar to the one they have previously watched and second is   to create an IMDb rating prediction system. In that way, when a new movie is going to be released, its IMDb rating can be predicted.
- At the beginning data merging and data cleaning was performed.
- After that, various EDA analysis were applied as well as Spearman and Pearson Correlation was performed to see the correlated features.
- We implemented 2 unsupervised machine learning algorithms, those  are Cosine Similarity and K-means clustering for the recommendation system.
- And then we implemented 3 supervised machine learning algorithms for IMDB rating prediction system. Two of them are classification algorithms which are KNN and Random Forest classification.
- Then, we tried to determine the best algorithms for both recommendation and prediction systems.
